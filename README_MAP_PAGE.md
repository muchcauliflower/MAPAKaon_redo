# Documentation for mapping algorithm and the map page in genearl in this readme page.

## Started 9 June 2025 2109 (amazing)

Things to tackle on
1) What is this section about?
2) How to implement our algorithm?
3) Though process for how this works
4) Other things

Lets get right to it

### 1. What is this algorithm/section about?

Simply. The purpose of writing this section is simpkly to document and remember what im supposed to be doing
This section will explain what i'm going to do in terms of implementing the algorithm

Steps:

1. Implementation of routing and routing data
2. Implement dijkstra's and from point A to point B
3. Add multiple points (To mimic multiple travelling points
4. Add parameters in the algorithm
5. UI/UX (there already is a rough draft on this on figma)

Implementation of routing and routing data
